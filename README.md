Rabbit Coop Simulation

This application is a simple program within a set of applications that simulate the reproduction of animals. The application is created using .Net Core and Razor Page. The application only takes input from the user regarding the number of days the simulation will run.

The rest of the information is stored in a configuration.txt file as a Comma Separated Vector (CSV). "Id, Species, Sex, Age, AverageDeathAge, IsPregnant" are the features of the animals. The "OptimalCageCapacity" is the value that causes the animals in the cage to live harder and die after reaching this number. The value can be changed but the format should remain the same.

After the user enters the number of days that need to pass (e.g. 60), the simulation starts immediately and gives a graph showing the number of rabbits by day. The user can regenerate the simulation by pressing the left button below the graph. The simulation gives different results for every press. If the user wants to change the number of days, the user needs to press "enter different number" and go back to the main page.

Below the graph, the other necessary information about the simulation can be found.
